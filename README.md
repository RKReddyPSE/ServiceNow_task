1. What can you say about the complexity of your code?
Answer: 
The code's complexity is primarily determined by the number of sentences in the input file (O(n)). The grouping operation, while involving iterating over distinct patterns, is typically not a dominant factor in the overall complexity. Therefore, the code is efficient and should perform well for reasonably large input files.

2. How will your algorithm scale?
Answer: 
The algorithm should perform efficiently for a reasonably large number of sentences. However, if the input file contains an extremely large number of sentences, it may be necessary to consider memory constraints, and potential optimizations may be needed.


3. If you had two weeks to do this task, what would you have done differently? What 
would be better?
Answer:
With additional time, I would focus on enhancing the code's robustness, usability, and performance while ensuring it remains well-documented and maintainable.
